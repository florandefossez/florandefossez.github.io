My name is Floran, and I'm currently a student at Centrale Nantes, a French engineering school.
The aim of my blog is to share some experiments and findings on various subjects related to computing and programming.

I think documenting my learning journey and presenting the information as succinctly goes a long way to helping people understand topics. I also hope that my future posts will provide you with valuable content. Your feedback is always welcome and appreciated!
